Gemtracker
==========

Gemtracker makes sure your Rails application uses the same gems and
versions, no matter where it's deployed.

All you have to do is specify a list of gems in "config/gems.yml". When
script/server or script/console is run, Gemtracker ensures that all the
gems are present and at the correct version, throwing an exception if
they can't be found.

Gemtracker comes with a rake task, "gems:install", which installs all
gems listed in "config/gems.yml" at the specified versions, if not
already present.

Example
=======

config/gems.yml:

  mongrel: 1.0.1
  rspec  : 1.0.0
  facets : 0.4
  foobar : 0.1.0

Using fuzzy versions as supported by Rubygems should work, but is not
encouraged. After all, you're trying to make sure that everyone has the
same gems and versions, right?

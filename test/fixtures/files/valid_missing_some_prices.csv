1856075265,"Two thousand years of Christianity and Ireland",,"Edited by J. R. Bartlett & S. D. Kinsella","192pp",,"Paperback",$14.99,"How did Christianity arrive in Ireland? How long did its reputation as an island of saints and scholars last? Why did the Reformation not take hold in Ireland? What impact did the Penal laws have on religious practice? What does the future hold for Christianity in Ireland in the twenty-first century? These are some of the questions considered in this collection of eleven essays originally given as lectures at Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin.
Sean Freyne traces the origins of Christianity and its spread through the Roman Empire, while the introduction of Christianity into Ireland and the establishment of the primacy of Armagh is examined by Catherine Swift. Many of the coastal cities of Ireland were Viking in origin, and Howard Clarke gives a case study of the conversion of the Dublin Vikings to Christianity. Michael Haren expands on the intricacy of papal bureaucracy in the medieval period, while Marie Therese Flanagan traces the complex causes of the reformation of the Irish church in the twelfth century. Bernadette Williams gives an overview of the mendicant orders in Ireland in the late medieval period. The Reformation period is dealt with by Colm Lennon in his essay on its implementation and on the Counter-Reformation which ensued. For the modern period, James Kelly addresses the topic of the Ascendancy and the Penal laws, while Andrew Pierce examines theological and ecclesiastical developments of the nineteenth century. In the final essay, which focuses particularly on ecumenism, Ferdinand von Prondzynski discusses the challenges facing the Irish churches in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.
No single volume can claim to be a definitive history of two thousand years of Christianity, but this collection of essays provides an accessible introduction to the topic from an Irish perspective. In a world ever more polarised by religious conflict, one modest hope of this book is that it would encourage the inquisitive non-specialist to delve further into the myriad complexities of over two millennia of religious history and culture.

1856075516,"Ever Ancient Ever New","Celtic Spirituality in the 21st century","Dolores Whelan","160pp",,"Paperback",$12.99,"The Celtic spiritual and wisdom tradition is, paradoxically, very ancient and very new.  It is a way of perceiving reality and a way of being in the world. The wisdom of this tradition is re-emerging, at this time, from centuries of marginalization. Much of the wisdom held within this tradition has similarities with that found in other primal cultures. The wisdom of the Celtic tradition will speak in a particular way to those having roots or links, however tentative, with the Celtic soul or consciousness.

This book emphasises the need for modern humans to inhabit those dimensions of reality that once created the world of the Celtic people. These realms which still exist in our psyches, but have been marginalised over the centuries. The focus of the book is the reclamation of specific gifts from our ancestry in the Celtic past that might serve humanity today.

 - The importance of cyclical time as reflected in the Celtic Year calendar
 - The importance of mythic consciousness in creating healthy society
 - The importance of vibrant rituals in the spiritual well being of people.
 - The understanding of the unbroken wholeness of the universe
 - The sacredness of the living earth
 - The essential role darkness and of death in the life and soul journey.
 - The reclamation of the role of the Divine Feminine.

1856075524,"Praying with the 
Women  Mystics","Selected, compiled and interpreted by","Mary T. Malone","128pp",,"Paperback",$9.99,"These prayer- poems were written in an attempt to make the writings of Christian women, most, but not all of them, mystics, accessible to the contemporary believing community, and to women in particular. The thematic content of this spiritual writing can often differ quite dramatically from male spiritual writing, and these poems are primarily focused on these differences. The themes include: the gendered naming of God (Mother, Lady-Love, Lady Wisdom, Sophia, as well as the more usual Lord, Father, King), the sense of immediate access to God claimed by women who were generally deemed, in traditional religious understanding, to be daughters of Eve and the cause of sin, and the courage to speak the things of God publicly even though almost all Christian teaching mandated the silencing of women. An essential ingredient in these mystical prayers was a new sense of the full humanity of women rooted, perhaps primarily, in their experience of the Eucharistic humanity of Jesus.

The poems are placed in contemporary settings, using contemporary language, and sometimes addressing contemporary issues, in an effort to communicate the radical nature of the writing of the women mystics. Each poem is rooted in these mystical themes and is liberally sprinkled with words and phrases from the named woman mystic. It is the writer’s hope that the courteous and homely nature of the divine-human encounter, as illustrated by these women often hundreds of years ago, will be communicated to a contemporary readership.

1856075397,"The Responsorial Psalms of Sunday",,"Silvester O’Flynn OFM Cap","176pp",,"Paperback",,"The psalms are prayers from the time before Christ and were used in Jewish liturgies. As a school of prayer, they continue to provide us with the language of prayer.

A section of a psalm, usually no more than three or four verses, is used in the Liturgy of the Word every day at Mass. It is called the Responsorial Psalm because it is intended to be a response or echo of the first reading of the day.

On the Sundays in Ordinary Time, the first reading itself is chosen as a preparation for the gospel of the day, so we find that the psalm, while echoing the Old Testament reading, also anticipates the gospel. However, in the seasons of Advent, Christmas, Lent and Easter, since the first reading has no deliberate connection with the gospel, neither is there a thematic connection between the psalm and the gospel.

This book of reflections on the responsorial psalms is offered to all who wish to draw more sustenance for their prayer from the liturgical readings of each Sunday. 
To attain the full benefit of these reflections it will be necessary to read them in conjunction with the other readings.

Let the Reader Understand offers short explanations of the readings used on Sundays during Year C of the liturgical cycle. The explanations seek to help anyone who wishes to get more out of the Liturgy of the Word at Sunday Mass. For many lay people who have little or no training in theology, including Readers, the readings can be difficult to understand, so this book begins with an introductory article about the use of the Bible at Mass and then gives helpful comments on each reading and a reflection for each Sunday.

1856075486,"Walsingham Prayers and Reflections",,"John Rayne-Davis","80pp",,"Hardback",$14.99,"In the year 1061 a sleepy little village in the depths of rural Norfolk was transformed. The Lady Richeldis of Walsingham had a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary. She was transported in spirit to the Holy Land and shown the house in which Our Lady was told that she would be the Mother of God. The Blessed Virgin commanded Richeldis to build an exact replica of this house in Walsingham, which was to be known as ‘England’s Nazareth’, a title incidentally that Walsingham holds to this day.

Walsingham today is England’s most popular pilgrimage site for both Roman Catholics and Anglicans. This collection of prayers and reflections focuses on the relevance and restfulness of Walsingham in the busy distracting world in which we live today.

The Pynson Ballad tells us that when Mary asked Richeldis to build a house in Walsingham to be a memorial of the house where the Annunciation took place, she said : “All who seek me there will find succour”. It is still true today that many people, who are troubled with the kind of problems that John Rayne-Davis highlights in his prayers and reflections, find succour there. I am sure that many will find succour from reading this book and that many others will be inspired to come to Walsingham to seek that succour from Mary herself. I am pleased to commend this book.
Fr Noel Wynn SM, Director of the RC National Shrine.

Another fine book from the pen of John Rayne-Davis. John has a real gift of writing prayers and reflections which link our troubled, and sometimes broken, world with our personal devotions.
This book will sustain many as they follow Our Lord in the rough and tumble of daily life.

The readers of the gospel are invited to identify with the likes of the elderly Simeon who declares ‘My eyes have seen your salvation which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples.’
 
The reflections in this book on the Sunday readings for the year of Luke (Year C) are offered as a resource to homilists, to members of prayer groups and bible reflection groups, and to anyone who wishes to prayerfully reflect on the Sunday readings. The year of Luke is a renewed opportunity to recognise God’s visitiation to us in the person of Jesus and, like Mary, to hear God’s word and to submit to it.

","Thomas J. Norris","104pp",,"Paperback",,"People want to experience more, to understand more, to know more – all in order to be more. This is the task of education as the search for reality. 

Education is a big word. It hands on the knowledge and wisdom gained over the ages in order to enable the new generations to find reality, and not shadows. This is true at the first, second and third levels of education. 

This meditation, inspired in part by the author’s own teachers and his experience as an educator, revisits the foundations of the educational enterprise. In doing so, it draws from authors both ancient and modern, from Aristotle to Newman, from Plato to Voegelin and Lonergan.
The result is the proposal of key principles to guide the journey like those stars that once guided navigators through the currents of the ocean to harbour. These include the ‘anthropology’, ‘liberality’, ‘rationality’, ‘apostolic’ and ‘inclusivity’ principles or imperatives.

Beginning as the Dublin Bible Society, it very quickly became nationwide, with branches, auxiliaries and associated societies in every county. As the Hibernian Bible Society it distributed copies of the Scriptures without comment in this country, and through the British and Foreign Bible Society contributed to their worldwide dissemination.

Reorganised in the 1960s as the National Bible Society of Ireland in the Irish Republic and as the Bible Society in Northern Ireland, it now participates very fully in the work of the United Bible Societies.

The author traces the history of the Society through a number of controversies, and its responses to changing political and religious opinion.
